<h2>1. Description of Service; Eligibility</h2>

You can authorize SmartNest to refuse to accept any further transactions initiated under that password on your behalf and SmartNest will use commercially reasonable efforts to block such transactions.</p>

<h2>7. Third-Party Payment Processors</h2>

<p>SmartNest uses third party service providers for payment services such as credit card acceptance, bank account debits, merchant settlement and related services. By using some or all of these payment services on or in connection with the Service, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions and privacy policy of such third-party payment processor. If you are paying by credit card, your payment will be processed by Braintree, whose terms are available at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/landing/gateway-terms-of-service">https://www.braintreepayments.com/landing/gateway-terms-of-service</a>. If you choose to pay by direct bank account debit, eCheck or ACH, your payment will be processed by Dwolla, whose terms are found at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dwolla.com/legal/tos/">https://www.dwolla.com/legal/tos/</a> and privacy policy at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dwolla.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.dwolla.com/legal/privacy/</a>.

If you choose the PayNearMe option, your payment is governed by their terms and privacy policy, available at <a target="_blank" href="http://consumers.paynearme.com/en/terms/">http://consumers.paynearme.com/en/terms/</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://consumers.paynearme.com/en/privacy/">http://consumers.paynearme.com/en/privacy/</a>, respectively. You consent and authorize us to delegate the authorizations and share the information you provide to us with these third-party payment processors to the extent required to provide the payment services to you.</p>

<h2>8. Payments</h2>

<p><b>Applications</b>. If you apply to rent an apartment from Property Client through the Service, you agree to pay all application fees, billable immediately to the account identified in your application for the purpose of application processing, which fees are earned upon the submission and receipt of an application. If payment is made by eCheck/ACH, you understand that if such payment is returned from the bank for any reason, you may be charged additional returned item fee(s), which will be added to the original amount and auto-debited from your bank account approximately ten (10) days after the initial payment fails. In the event that subsequent fee collection auto-debits also fail, you may continue to incur fees related to such attempts. You assume all responsibility for all such fees. Returned item fees vary; please contact your leasing office for details. Additional fees may also be assessed by your bank and/or Property Client. Your copy of the application will serve as a receipt for the application fee collected.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a lease, no guarantees are made to you that a property rental is or will be made available. SmartNest has no role in determining whether your application is successful; your application is solely between you and the Property Client. You understand that you will acquire no rights in or to a property rental until you accept and sign a rental agreement with Property Client and pay all applicable application fees and security deposits.</p>

<p><b>SmartNest Fee</b>. Convenience fees on all rental payments (the “SmartNest Fee,” set forth on our Fees Page) is charged by us, and not by your Property Client. The SmartNest Fee is not a surcharge. We are a third-party vendor who is not the seller, lessor, or management company of any rental property. The SmartNest Fee is not being charged based on any method of payment. All payment methods initiated through the Site are charged the SmartNest Fee, including credit card, debit card, electronic checks, and cash payments made through PayNearMe. These fees are being charged by us for providing the convenience of an online payment channel.</p>

<p>You hereby acknowledge that we and/or the Property Client may apply a SmartNest Fee to each transaction initiated through our Service. We may amend this SmartNest Fee at any time with or without notice. All SmartNest Fees will be displayed on the payment screen prior to finalizing your transaction.</p>

<p><b>Authorizations</b>. You authorize the Property Client to obtain such credit reports, criminal histories, character reports, verification of rental and employment history as it deems necessary to verify all information in your application, and you authorize SmartNest to collect and transfer that information from the Property Client and/or on the Property Client’s behalf in accordance with this Agreement. You further understand that false, fraudulent, misleading or incomplete information may be grounds for denial of tenancy or subsequent eviction.</p>

<p>You hereby authorize us to initiate transaction entries, including the convenience fees noted herein, to your transaction account number (including checking and savings accounts) and/or charges to your credit card. This billing will occur at the time of payment of each transaction.</p>

<p>We advise you that your credit card or bank account billing statement will show a charge item that displays the name of the merchant account of the Property Client. If you are unsure of that name, you agree to contact Property Client before processing this transaction so as to be sure to recognize the transaction when it appears on your monthly statement.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse to process any of your transactions and/or cancel your account at any time for any reason. Your Property Client may also decline/refuse any and all payments at any time and for any reason. In the event that your payment is declined or refused for any reason, SmartNest will return the payment amount using whatever method of payment you used for the original payment, minus convenience fees paid, within a reasonable time frame. You also maintain the ability to discontinue use of the Service at any time for any reason.</p>
  
<p>Active recurring payments must be deleted before use of service is discontinued. It is your responsibility to terminate any and all recurring payments on your account before relocating or moving - otherwise charges will continue to be assessed to your billing account during the period designated for recurring payments to take place. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any recurring payments that are charged by accident or because you failed to cancel your recurring payment. We, in our sole discretion, may cancel any active recurring payments without notice.</p>

<p>If you believe a transaction was made improperly, we in our sole discretion may void, issue a credit, or rescind any transaction made through the Service prior to remittance of such payment to your Property Client. Payment disputes arising after payment has been settled to your Property Client are between you and Property Client alone. We may act as an intermediary if such actions can reasonably and efficiently handle said problem.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account or transaction from you if you provide us with information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You may not use the Service for any illegal purpose or in any manner inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement. You agree that our services shall only be used for lawful purposes. Any transaction or transmission which violates federal, state or local laws is expressly prohibited. You hereby authorize us to investigate and confirm the information herein. For this purpose we may utilize credit bureau/reporting agencies and/or our own agents. Upon your request, we will provide you with a copy of the results of such investigation if needed. However, you must request such documentation within fourteen (14) days of becoming aware of the investigation.</p>

<p>We and your Property Client seek to comply with all payment processing rules and regulations. If you believe you have been charged a fee in error, please contact the Property Client to whom your payment is submitted.</p>

<h2>9. Indemnity</h2>

<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless SmartNest, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and suppliers, from and against all claims, actions or demands, liabilities, and settlements, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising in connection with your use of the Site or the Service or resulting from, or alleged to result from, your use of the Site or the Service or your violation of this Agreement or any law.</p>

Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Service. SmartNest uses cookies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor, to improve the quality of our Service, and to make your browsing experience meaningful. When you enter our Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize your computer but not specifically who is using it. By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the Service, then we know that the cookie information relates to you. Some of the code and cookies used by our Service are served by us, and some are served by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.</p>

<p>Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. By blocking or deleting cookies used on our Service, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Service.</p>

<p>Some services that we use, such as Google Analytics or the third party payment providers, use web tags and may also place their own cookies on your browser, and individual blogs on our network may contain code that places their own cookies. Such third-party cookies are not governed by this Privacy Policy, but by the privacy policies of such third party.</p>

Storage by the third party payment providers of your Payment Information is subject to the privacy policies and practices of the third party payment providers and is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. By providing your Payment Information, you acknowledge and agree to use of such information by the third party payment providers for purposes of processing your payment to the Property Client.</p>

<p>We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions.  Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments.  When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, which may include Personal Information.</p>

<p>If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the information that we have collected, including Personal Information, would be transferred along with our other business assets.</p>

<p>When compelled to do so, we may disclose your information, including Personal Information, to government authorities and to other third parties, at our discretion, or otherwise as required by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose such information when we have reason to believe that someone is or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Service, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>

<p>The information we collect and/or receive from you may be disclosed, as described above, to Property Client, its affiliates, Credit Bureaus and, other financial institutions with whom joint marketing agreements exist, or to companies that perform services or functions on their behalf. These companies may include financial service providers and non-financial companies such as computer and data processing companies, and marketing and aftermarket service providers.</p>

<h2>3. How We Protect Your Information</h2>

<p>SmartNest will take commercially reasonable measures to safeguard your information. However, as effective as any security measure implemented by SmartNest may be, no security system is impenetrable. SmartNest cannot guarantee the complete security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. If you do not want SmartNest or the Property Client to know any particular information about you, you should not include that information in anything you submit or post to this Site.</p>

<h2>4. Links and Third Party Sites</h2>

<p>The Site and the Service may contain links to third party sites. We do not endorse such third party sites nor are we responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware when leaving our Site of the privacy statements and terms & conditions of each website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2>5. Important Notice to Non-U.S. Residents</h2>

<p>The Site and the Service are operated in the United States.  If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer.</p> 

<h2>6. Children</h2>

<p>Nothing on this website is intended to specifically solicit information from minors (people under eighteen (18) years old) or to seek to determine whether the visitor is a minor. If you are under eighteen (18), you are not permitted to submit to us any personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would permit us to identify you. If you are under the age of thirteen (13), it is against the law for us to ask you for that information, and we will not ask for it, nor do we want it. Anyone under 18 who wants to obtain any product from SmartNest or otherwise submit any personally identifiable information to us should ask a parent or guardian to do it in his/her own name. Because such information will not be specifically identified as being from minors, users of this website should be aware that personally identifiable information submitted to it by minors may be treated in the same manner as information given by an adult. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

<p>You may update the information that is stored in your user account by e-mailing us at info@mysmartnest.com. We may retain certain information as required by law or for necessary business purposes.</p>

<h2>8. Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy. Any such changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted here on our Site so we urge to please visit this page frequently. In all cases, use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>9. California Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing by email to  or mail a letter to:</p>
